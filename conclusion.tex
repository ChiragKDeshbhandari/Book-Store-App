\section{Conclusion}
In this Book Store project, we understood how to create a online shopping related application
with a beautiful UI design using Android Java. We can customize this project and add as many
books to improve the number of customers for our app. This app is very useful for book lovers
as there is no need to go for book shop physically but now books are avaialable to buy online


\section{Future Works}
Though our project has been completed but still betterment is always an open door. In this
case also we can improve it by: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Making the user-interface more interactive. 
\item Adding more graphical user interface
\item We can integrate our application with various book stalls so that all are available under one roof.
\item We can add text-to-speech and speech-to-text feature in our app to make it more accessible for people with disadvantages and for normal users. 
\end{itemize}
