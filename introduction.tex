 This app allow the authors and book store owners to sell and rent their books to the people who are interested in reading those particular books in return for money.

With the help of an online book store marketplace, users can simply make their accounts on this app, if they want to use and start looking up the books they are interested in.

By applying filters and entering the author name of the book they are looking for or a keyword, they get a variety of suggestions.

There, they get a lot of options to choose from and add the book they are interested in buying to the cart and make the payment.

Payment mode is cash on delivery, where the customer will get an OTP after ordering the books. The delivery boy asks the OTP from the customer and confirms the delivery at your doorstep.


\subsection{Problem Statement}
We need to understand that bookstores are not just a place to sell a product. Bookstores are
one of the most important elements of any high street – we give advice, we give directions, we
act as tour guides and we host events and help keep local communities alive. We also try to sell
them books.We are a nation known for fantastic writers and bookstores are part of our culture.
If we value this we need to support our local stores.
